# responsive-google-maps

The iframe used to display google maps can sometimes break when placed within a column (or container). To solve this, some simple CSS can make the container it is in flexible and it should display on most screen sizes.

The example shown here was made for the Department of Language and Literacy Education at the University of British Columbia. Be sure to grab the correct embed code for your own department location by going to maps.google.com, finding a place and then clicking on the embed link.

##Note

Paste contents of the html into your web page. Paste contents of the CSS file into your own stylesheet. The CSS file here is **not** a file referenced by the html file.
